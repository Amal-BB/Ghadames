            Ghadames, known as 'the pearl of the desert' (Jawhart Al-Sahra) by Arab sources,
             stands in an oasis, on the edge of the Sahara next to a spring of water called ‘Spring of Filly’. It is one of the oldest pre-Saharan cities and an outstanding example of a traditional settlement. It has played a key role in the cultural and economic life of the region as an important and peaceful hub for caravan trade as part of the trans-Saharan network.
