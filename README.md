## 7. Bugs and Fixing

All reported bugs from testing has been fixed.

### **Fixed Bugs**

* By testing the website on small screen devices like _iPhonSE_, I noticed that the burger menu didn't appear clear as it was close to the logo side, This issue was addressed by reducing logo `font size` and `padding` properties in the style sheet for screens of maximum width 490 pixels.

  ![Mobile menu bug](readme-images/menu-bug.PNG)

* Another issue was reported in the _iPhonSE_, that just a little of the event description text appeared and the remaining was covered by the image. This issue was solved by adjusting the text `Div` height.

  ![Event text bug](readme-images/event-bug.PNG)

* A Desktop monitor user reported that there was an issue with the place of the Email label in the contact form as shown in the image. By changing the `display` property of the label the issue was fixed

  > ![Form label bug](readme-images/form-bug.PNG)

* When I tested the website on a mobile device and tablet, I noticed changes in the size of most content texts during screen orientation change, which cause a messy look for content. So, by Setting the `text size adjust` for all browsers to 100%, the issue was fixed.

   ```css
   html {
    -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;
    -moz-text-size-adjust: 100%;
    -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;
    }
    ```
